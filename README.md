3. Media Tracking (Fantasy Forge): Users can track their favorite TV shows, movies, and games, with recommendations tailored to their interests and local culture.


## User Journey:

1. Profile Setup: A user creates a profile on LifeExplorer and selects interests in pet adoption, local exploration, and media tracking.
2. Adopting a Pet: The user browses pets available for adoption on Pawcare and sends an inquiry about a pet.
3. Exploring Local Spots: The user checks out local pet-friendly parks and cafes from the Local Guide App.
4. Tracking Media: The user tracks media items related to pet care and local culture on Fantasy Forge.
5. Integrated Experience: The userâ€™s profile shows pet-friendly locations, pet-related media suggestions, and local media recommendations, creating a rich, interconnected experience.
